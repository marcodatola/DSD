# DSD
Collection of ECS615U Digital Systems Design labs


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based upon Digital Design 4th Edition John F Wakerly, the Digital Systems Design module aims to provide knowledge on combinatorial and sequential circuits, solid-state (E)(E)(P)ROM and fully flexible field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Labs aim to provide an understanding of
1.     Introduction to the Xilinx VHDL programming, simulation and synthesis software. 
2.     Combinational Logic: Building an ALU and a Shifter/Rotator 
3.     Sequential Logic 1: Registers, Shift Registers and Ring Counters 
4.     Sequential Logic 2: Dividers, Synchronous Counters and State Machines 
5.     Memory: ROMs, RAMs and Register Files 
6.     Building a Microprogrammed Controller and Datapath
